# recommender.template
This template shows example usage of the Metis Machine platform for the purpose of building a recommendation engine model. Given a dataset of user IDs, item IDs, and ratings (either boolean or range), this template allows the user to get item recommendations for each user stored in a separate table. Here we use user votes (thumbs up and down) on various movies as the example use case.
